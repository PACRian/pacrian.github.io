# Understanding Memory Management in C++

Memory management is one of the most important concepts to master in C++. Unlike languages with automatic garbage collection, C++ gives you direct control over memory allocation and deallocation.

## Why Memory Management Matters

Efficient memory management is critical for:

- Preventing memory leaks
- Optimizing performance
- Avoiding crashes and undefined behavior

## Basic Concepts

### Stack vs Heap Memory

In C++, memory is primarily allocated in two ways:

1. **Stack Memory**: Automatic allocation/deallocation
2. **Heap Memory**: Manual allocation/deallocation

### Pointers and References

Pointers allow direct manipulation of memory addresses:

```cpp
int* ptr = new int(10);  // Allocate memory on the heap
*ptr = 20;               // Modify the value
delete ptr;              // Free the memory
```

References provide an alternative that's often safer:

```cpp
int x = 10;
int& ref = x;  // Reference to x
ref = 20;      // Modifies x directly
```

## Modern C++ Memory Management

C++11 introduced smart pointers to help manage memory automatically:

- `std::unique_ptr`: Exclusive ownership
- `std::shared_ptr`: Shared ownership with reference counting
- `std::weak_ptr`: Non-owning reference to shared objects

Example:

```cpp
#include <memory>

void example() {
  std::unique_ptr<int> uniq = std::make_unique<int>(42);
  std::shared_ptr<int> shared = std::make_shared<int>(100);
  
  // No need to call delete - memory is cleaned up automatically
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Prefer stack allocation when possible
2. Use smart pointers instead of raw pointers
3. Follow the RAII principle (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
4. Use container classes instead of manual arrays
5. Be consistent with ownership semantics

## Conclusion

Mastering memory management in C++ takes practice, but it gives you powerful control over your program's performance and resource usage.
